```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The `%>%` operator takes the object on its left and uses as the first argument to the function on its right.

```{r}

2 %>% sum(5)
```

is equivalent to

```{r}
sum(2, 5)

```

Order matters for the pipe!

```{r}
"Ashwin" %>% paste("My name is")
```

What we really wanted

```{r}
paste("My name is", "Ashwin")
```

Pipe  makes the code more readable when there are several nested functions.

```{r}
summary(lm(hwy ~ cty, data = mpg))
```

```{r}
lm(hwy ~ cty, data = mpg) %>% 
  summary()
```

This will throw an error! Why?

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  lm(hwy ~ cty) %>% 
  summary()
```

```{r}
mpg %>% 
  lm(hwy ~ cty, data = .) %>% 
  summary()
```


Note, as of today, the latest version of R has introduced its own pipe |> operator! However, it doesn't replicate all the functions of `%>%` so I don't use it.
